# WUST-Beamer-Presentation-Theme
Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (WUST) Beamer Presentation Theme

There is a Beamer template, that is modified versions of the [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) Beamer Presentation Theme](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/sintef-presentation/jhbhdffczpnx) template from [Qi-long Liu](mailto:qilong-kirov.liu@connect.polyu.hk) that is based on [SINTEF Presentation](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/sintef-presentation/jhbhdffczpnx) template from [Federico Zenith](mailto:federico.zenith@sintef.no) (all rights reserved by him).

A big thanks to Federico Zenith and Qi-long Liu for creating such beautifully designed templates. Iâ€™ve made some changes connected with adding icons proper for WUST, and included new features to better suit the needs of my friends' and my own institutes.


## Options & usage

### Switch college/institute

The code is consistent with the code provided in the [Qi-long Liu's GitHub repository](https://github.com/liu-qilong/college-beamer). To switch to the WUST theme, add `wust, en` to the package:

```
\usepackage[wust,en]{collegeBeamer}
```
if you want to use english version of the slides or
```
\usepackage[wust,pl]{collegeBeamer}
```
to select polish language. 


You can find the remaining available options and settings in the source code: [Qi-long Liu's GitHub repository](https://github.com/liu-qilong/college-beamer).
